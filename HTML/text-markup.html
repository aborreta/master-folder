    <h2> This is the practice code for HTML Text Markup </h2>

    <h3> Headings </h3>
      <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
      <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
      <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
      <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
      <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
      <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>

    <hr/> <!-- <hr/> puts a line break and <br/ puts a space break -->
    
    <h3> Paragraphs </h3>
      <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p> <!-- sentences in between <p></p> tags makes up one sentence -->
      <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text. For example, a book may have
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.</p>

    <hr/>
    
    <h3> <b>Bold</b> </h3>
      <p>This is how we make a word appear <b>bold.</b></p> <!-- <b></b> makes the texts in between the tags to be in bold -->
      <p>Inside a product description, you might see some <b>key features</b> in bold.</p>

    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Italize </h3>
      <p>This is how we make a word appear <i>italic</i>.</p> <!-- <i></i> makes the texts in between the tags became italized -->
      <p>It's a potato <i>Solanum teberosum</i>.</p>
      <p>Captain Cook sailed to Australia on the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>

    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Superscript and Subscript </h3>
      <p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn about E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p> <!-- texts between <sup></sup> makes them show in superscript -->
      <p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p> <!-- texts between <sub></sub> makes them show in subscript -->

    <hr/>
    
    <h3> White Space </h3>
      <p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
      <p>The moon     is drifting away from Earth.</p> <!-- take note that spaces put in between the text within the tags are considered one space -->
      <p>The moon is drifting away from
          
              Earth.</p>
    
    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Strong </h3>
      <p><strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in this area.</p> <!-- <strong> tags indicates that the text between the tags have strong importance and shows in bold as default -->
      <p>This toy has many small pieces and is <strong>not suitable for children under five years old.</strong></p>
    
    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Emphasis </h3>
      <p>I <em>think</em> Ivy was the first.</p> <!-- <strong> tags indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of sentence and shows in italic as default -->
       <p>I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first.</p>
      <p>I think Ivy was the <em>first</em>.</p>
    
    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Quotations </h3>
      <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh"> <!-- <blockquote> is used for longer quotes, should not use to indent a piece of text and advised to achieve this effect using CSS -->
        <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p> <!-- <q> is used in shorter quotes; many browsers supposed to put quotes around the <q> tags but InEx does not, so many people avoid using the <q> tag -->

      <!-- values of the quotes should be a URL that will have more info about the source of the quoteation -->
    
    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Abbreviations and Acronyms </h3>
      <p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>
      <p><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> do some crazy space stuff.</p>
    
    <!-- the title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term; take note that in HTML4, there is a separate <acronym> tag for acronyms but HTML5 only uses <abbr> for both abbreviation and acronym -->
    
    <hr/>
    
    <h3> Citations and Definitions </h3>
      <p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>
          <!-- <cite> is used to cite a piece of work as reference; take note that in HTML5, it is not allow to use <cite> on a person's name but is allowed in HTML4, shows in italic as default -->
      <p>A <dfn>black hole</dfn> is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
          <!-- <dfn> is used to define a terminoloy in a document for the first time; take note that some browsers shows content of the <dfn> tags in italic but Safari and Chrome does not -->

    <hr/>
